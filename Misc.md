__Reminders:__

- ~~Define game board (6 Rows, 7 Columns)~~
- ~~42 total discs (7x7)~~
- ~~Add both singe and multiplayer mode, create new function for handling choice~~
- ~~Logic for Placing a piece~~
- ~~add function for winning conditions~~
- ~~handle condition controlled Game loop~~
- ~~add Computer Difficulty~~
- ~~Update other function arguments~~
- ~~Update main()~~
- ~~Add score counter (learn lambda)~~
- Add input for how much MAX_DEPTH


__Issues:__

- Score Counter not updating (help)
- ~~Sort out Max Depth~~
- ~~Win bugs, (possibly in check_win function)~~
- ~~Index out of range error (idk why ffs)~~

**Minimax:**

- ~~Scrap def computer_asian()~~
- ~~Sort out Max Depth and Bonus Score~~
- ~~Add priority for Centre~~
- ~~Check for 2,3 in a row~~

__GUI (Pygame):__
